% SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION
%
% Give the scientific justification for the proposed observations.
% This section should consist of paragraphs of text (and may include
% EPS figures) that follow the \justification line.
% Try to include an explanation of the overall significance to astronomy.

% In order to include an EPS plot, you should use the LaTeX "figure"
% environment.  The plot file is included with the \plotone{FILENAME}
% command; two side-by-side plot files can be included by typing
% \plottwo{FILENAME1}{FILENAME2}.  Use \caption{} to specify a caption.
% The \epsscale{} command can be used to scale \plotone plots if they
% appear too large on the printed page.

% \begin{figure}
% \epsscale{0.85}
% \plotone{sample.eps}
% \caption{Sample figure showing important results.}
% \end{figure}
%
% If you need to rotate or make other transformations to a figure, you may
% use the \plotfiddle command:
% \plotfiddle{PSFILE}{VSIZE}{ROTANG}{HSCALE}{VSCALE}{HTRANS}{VTRANS}
% \plotfiddle{sample.eps}{2.6in}{-90.}{32.}{32.}{-250}{225}
% where HSCALE and VSCALE are percentages and HTRANS and VTRANS are
% in PostScript units, 72 PS units = 1 inch.

\justification
The gradual decline in angular momentum over time is a well-established
phenomenon in cool (FGK) Main Sequence (MS) stars (\eg Weber \& Davis 1968;
Skumanich 1972; Kawaler 1989; Barnes 2003; Barnes 2007; Mamajek \&
Hillenbrand 2008; Meibom \etal 2010; Angus \etal 2015; van Saders \etal
2016).
This phenomenon is attributed to magnetic braking: angular momentum is carried
away by magnetised stellar winds and is often used as an astronomical clock.
Stellar rotation periods increase (angular frequency decreases) with age, and
the power-law slope of that relation depends, to first order, only on
stellar mass.
Although several studies have observed, characterised and calibrated the
relation between rotation period and stellar age, the level of dispersion, the
'intrinsic scatter' in these relations is thus unknown.
The precision with which an age can be predicted from a rotation period has
not, therefore been quantified.
Open clusters are useful tools for calibrating stellar properties since (we
assume) their members formed at the same time from the same molecular cloud.
These stellar populations containing tens to thousands of members are
excellent test-beds for age-rotation relations since, being coeval, the stars'
rotation periods should depend only on their mass.
Binaries are minimum-member stellar populations which also, presumably, form
at the same epoch.
These astronomical objects provide additional tests of age-rotation relations
since again, the rotation periods of two stars in a binary system should
depend only on their masses.
In addition, they are often in more isolated environments than open clusters
and are likely to have a different dynamical history.
Semyeong Oh has identified several comoving pairs of stars in the first
release of \gaia data which will be excellent test subjects for the
age-rotation relations.
{\bf We hope to demonstrate that rotation period is an excellent tracer of
stellar age and to quantify the intrinsic scatter in the age-rotation
relations using comoving pairs in the \Gaia\ \TGAS\ catalogue.}

The \gaia spacecraft is an astrometric mission designed to, amongst other
things, measure proper motions and parallaxes for a billion stars in the
galaxy.
The first data release (DR1) contained proper motions (in the plane of the
sky) and parallaxes for two million bright stars with apparent magnitudes of
12 and above.
These data were searched for pairs and groups of stars with similar proper
motions and parallaxes to produce a catalogue of comoving pair and group
candidates.
Some of these candidates will be members of thus unknown, newly discovered
moving groups, others will be members of wide binaries.
Our confidence in the fidelity of these comoving stars' identities is
high --- we have selected only candidates with a less than 1 in 10,000 chance
that they are moving with similar velocities at similar distances by random
conincidence.
There may still be some contamination however, since the \gaia DR1 contained
only proper motions in RA and dec, not in the radial direction.
{\bf We require radial velocities (RVs) in order to improve the confidence in
the membership probabilities of these comoving candidates.}

Of the several thousand comoving pair candidates identified over the entire
sky, around 300 of these are in the \kepler field.
12 stars have rotation periods measured by McQuillan (2013) and we are
currently measuring rotation periods for the remainder.

% FEASIBILITY
%
% Assess the technical and scientific feasibility of the observations.
% This section should consist of text and tables only (no figures)
% following the \feasibility line.
%
% List objects, coordinates, and magnitudes (or surface brightness,
% if appropriate), desired S/N, wavelength coverage and resolution.
% Justify the number of nights requested as well as the specific
% telescope(s), instruments, and lunar phase.  Indicate the optimal
% detector, as well as acceptable alternates.  If you've requested
% long-term status, explain why this is necessary for successful
% completion of the science.

\feasibility

Our targets are bright (11th - 12th mag) and located in the \kepler field
($\alpha = , \gamma = $) which is best observed in July.
Based on the magnitudes of our targets, with average exposure times of 10-12
minutes, we require 7 nights in order to obtain RVs for 150 comoving pair
candidates in the \kepler\ field.
We expect to achieve an RV precision of 15-20 km s$^{-1}$, which will allow us
to assign improved membership probabilities to these comoving pairs and
groups.

% OTHER FACILITIES
%
% Why MDM? If you are using other facilities for this project,
% explain how the MDM observations fit into the scheme of things.
%
% This section should consist of text and tables only (no figures)
% following the \feasibility line.

\whymdm
These are ideal targets for queue observing since they are bright and require
short exposure times.
We are not submitting proposals to other facilities for this project.

% PAST USE
%
% List your allocation of telescope time at MDM during the
% past 3 years, and describe the status of the project (cite
% publications where appropriate).  Mark any allocations of time
% related to the current proposal with a \relatedwork{} command.
% Are your MDM observations achieving their goals?

\thepast
This is the first proposal for MDM lead by PI Ruth Angus.
