\begin{abstract}
The age-rotation relations (often called gyrochronology relations) are a
powerful tool for dating Main Sequence (MS) stars.
Unfortunately however, they suffer from poor calibration due to a lack
of rotation period data for stars with precise ages.
This problem has been somewhat remedied in recent years by the \kepler\
spacecraft (Borucki et al. 2010) which has obtained light curves for 10$^6$
stars with ten parts-per-million precision.
Signatures of stellar rotation are visible in many of these light curves and
rotation period catalogues have been compiled from the \kepler\ data set (\eg\
McQuillan \etal\ 2014, Garcia \etal\ 2014).
Attempts to test and calibrate the age-rotation relations have already been
made, using rotation periods of open clusters in the \kepler\ field of view
(\eg\ Meibom \etal\ 2011, Douglas \etal\ 2016) however, the rotational evolution
of field stars is still unknown (Angus \etal\ 2015, van Saders \etal\ 2016,
Metcalfe \etal\ 2016).
Investigating the rotational evolution of binaries and small moving groups
will allow us to bridge the gap between clusters and field stars.
Several new coeval groups of stars---binaries and comoving groups---within the
\kepler\ field have been identified using the first \gaia\ Data Release (DR1).
We require follow-up Radial Velocity (RV) measurements of these stars in order
to confirm their associations and test the age-rotation relations on a new,
unique sample of stars.

\justification
The gradual decline in angular momentum over time is a well-established
phenomenon in cool (FGK) MS stars (\eg\ Weber \& Davis 1968;
Skumanich 1972; Kawaler 1989; Barnes 2003; Barnes 2007; Mamajek \&
Hillenbrand 2008; Meibom \etal\ 2010; Angus \etal\ 2015; van Saders \etal\
2016).
This phenomenon is attributed to magnetic braking: angular momentum is carried
away by magnetised stellar winds.
Stellar rotation periods increase with age, and the intercept of that
power-law relation depends, to first order, only on stellar mass.
Rotation in cool MS stars can therefore be used as an astronomical clock.

Although several studies have observed, characterised and calibrated the
relation between rotation period and stellar age, the level of dispersion, the
`intrinsic scatter' in these relations is thus unknown.
The precision with which an age can be predicted from a rotation period has
not, therefore been quantified.
Open clusters are useful tools for calibrating stellar properties since (we
assume) their members formed at the same time from the same molecular cloud.
These stellar populations containing tens to thousands of members are
excellent test-beds for age-rotation relations since, being coeval, the
differences between the stars' rotation periods should depend only on their
mass.
Binaries are minimum-member stellar populations which also, presumably, form
at the same epoch.
These astronomical objects provide additional tests of age-rotation relations
since again, the difference between the rotation periods of two stars in a
binary system should depend only on their masses.
In addition, they are often in more isolated environments than open clusters
and are likely to have a different dynamical history.
Although rotational evolution appears to follow a simple power-law in open
clusters, that same behaviour is not always observed in old field stars (Angus
\etal\ 2015, van Saders \etal\ 2016, Metcalfe \etal\ 2016).
Small coeval groups such as wide binaries and small moving groups provide an
intermediate step between clusters and field stars and will allow us to bridge
the gap between their rotational behaviour.
Co-I Semyeong Oh has identified several comoving pairs of stars in the first
release of \gaia\ data (Gaia Collaboration 2016) which will be excellent test
subjects for the age-rotation relations.
{\bf We hope to demonstrate that rotation period is an excellent tracer of
stellar age and to quantify the intrinsic scatter in the age-rotation
relations using comoving pairs in the \Gaia\ \TGAS\ catalogue.}

The \gaia\ spacecraft is an astrometric mission designed to, amongst other
things, measure proper motions and parallaxes for a billion stars in the
galaxy.
The first data release contained proper motions (in the plane of the
sky) and parallaxes for two million bright stars with apparent magnitudes of
12 and above.
These data were searched for pairs and groups of stars with similar proper
motions and parallaxes to produce a catalogue of comoving pair and group
candidates.
Some of these candidates will be members of hitherto unknown, newly
discovered, moving groups and others will be members of wide binaries.
Our confidence in the fidelity of these comoving stars' identities is
high --- we have selected only candidates with a less than 1 in 10,000 chance
that they are moving with similar velocities at similar distances by random
conincidence.
There may still be some contamination however, since the \gaia\ DR1 contained
only proper motions in RA and dec, not in the radial direction.
{\bf We require radial velocities (RVs) in order to improve confidence in
the membership probabilities of these comoving candidates.}

Of the several thousand comoving pair candidates identified over the entire
sky, around 200 of these are in the \kepler\ field.
12 stars have rotation periods measured by McQuillan (2014) and we are
currently measuring rotation periods for the remainder.
Rotation periods can be measured from \kepler\ light curves due to the
presence of magnetically active regions with suppressed convection.
These regions are cooler, darker and rotate with the stellar surface, reducing
the overall luminosity of the star when they periodically come into view.
Since our ability to measure rotation periods for \kepler\ stars depends on
the number, size and temperature of active regions, the inclination of the
star, its apparent magnitude and the rotation period itself, it may not be
possible to measure rotation periods for all of these stars.
However, we apply a cut on light curve variance in order to select the most
promising candidates.
A larger variance within the light curve indicates that the amplitude of flux
variations caused by star spots is larger, increasing our chances of measuring
a rotation period.
We are currently developing a new probabilistic method for measuring rotation
periods, using a semi-parametric function; a Gaussian process.
This new method will allow us to measure rotation periods from light curves
with low-amplitude signals, including those that are quasi-periodic and
non-sinusoidal.
It will also allow us to produce an uncensored catalogue of samples from the
posterior probability density function of rotation periods with which we can
execute a sophisticated statistical analysis of this sample of comoving pairs.

% FEASIBILITY
%
% Assess the technical and scientific feasibility of the observations.
% This section should consist of text and tables only (no figures)
% following the \feasibility line.
%
% List objects, coordinates, and magnitudes (or surface brightness,
% if appropriate), desired S/N, wavelength coverage and resolution.
% Justify the number of nights requested as well as the specific
% telescope(s), instruments, and lunar phase.  Indicate the optimal
% detector, as well as acceptable alternates.  If you've requested
% long-term status, explain why this is necessary for successful
% completion of the science.

\feasibility

Our targets are bright (\gaia\ G-band, 6th - 12th mag) and mostly located in
the \kepler\ field ($\alpha = 291^{\circ}, \delta = 44^{\circ}$) which is best
observed in July.
We will also supplement our target list with stars from \ktwo\ fields which
are observable during February-July.

Based on the magnitudes of our targets, with exposure times ranging from 30s
for the brightest targets to 10 minutes for the faintest, we (conservatively)
estimate that we will need just six nights in order to obtain spectra for 200
stars in the \kepler\ and \ktwo\ fields.
We expect to achieve an RV precision of 15-20 km s$^{-1}$, which will allow us
to assign improved membership probabilities to these comoving pairs and
groups.

% OTHER FACILITIES
%
% Why MDM? If you are using other facilities for this project,
% explain how the MDM observations fit into the scheme of things.

\whymdm
These are ideal targets for queue observing since they are bright and require
short exposure times.
We are not submitting proposals to other facilities for this project.
